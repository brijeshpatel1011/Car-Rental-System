Chapter 1: Introduction
1.1 Aim of the Project :
The advancement in Information Technology and internet penetration has greatly enhanced various business processes and communication between companies (services provider) and their customers of which car rental industry is not left out. This E-Car Rental System is developed to provide the following services:
Enhance Business Processes: To be able to use internet technology to project the rental company to the global world instead of limiting their services to their local domain alone, thus increase their return on investment (ROI).
Online Vehicle Reservation: A tools through which customers can reserve available cars online prior to their expected pick-up date or time.
Customer’s registration: A registration portal to hold customer’s details, monitor their transaction and used same to offer better and improve services to them.
Group bookings: Allows the customer to book space for a group in the case of weddings or corporate meetings (Event management).

1.2 Project Scope :
This project traverses a lot of areas ranging from business concept to computing field, and required to perform several researches to be able to achieve the project objectives. The are a covers include:
•	Car rental industry: This includes study on how the car rental business is being done process involved and opportunity that exist for improvement.
•	PHP Technology used for the development of the application.
•	General customers as well as the company’s staff will be able to use the system effectively.
•	Web-platform means that the system will be available for access 24/7 except when there is a temporary server issue which is expected to be minimal.


1.3 Project Objective :
To produce a web-based system that allow customer to register and reserve car online and for the company to effectively manage their car rental business.
	To ease customer’s task whenever they need to rent a car.
	As all the system is computerized, there is no need to fill any application form for renting purpose. So, the paperwork will be very less.
	To make sure a user gets his desire car as early as possible. The car rental system will provide a faster response to complete the process.

SQL :SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standardized programming language that's used to manage relational databases and perform various operations on the data in them. The uses of SQL include modifying database table and index structures; adding, updating and deleting rows of data; and retrieving subsets of information from within a database for transaction processing and analytics applications. Queries and other SQL operations take the form of commands written as statements -- commonly used SQL statements include select, add, insert, update, delete, create, alter and truncate. MySQL is a popular choice of database for use in web applications, and is a central component of the widely used LAMP open source web application software stack (and other 'AMP' stacks).

PHP : PHP is a server-side scripting language designed for web development but also used as a general-purpose programming language. PHP is now installed on more than 244 million websites and 2.1 million web servers. Originally created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1995, the reference implementation of PHP is now produced by The PHP Group. While PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page, it now stands for PHP: Hyper Text Preprocess. PHP code is interpreted by a webserver with a PHP processor module, which generates the resulting web page PHP commands can be embedded directly into an HTML source document rather than calling an external file to process data. It has also evolved to include a command-line interface capability and can be used in standalone graphical applications. PHP is free software released under the PHP License. PHP can be deployed on most web servers and also as a standalone shell on almost every operating system and platform, free of charge.

HTML5 : HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. It is the fifth and last major HTML version that is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation. The current specification is known as the HTML Living Standard. It is maintained by the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), a consortium of the major browser vendors (Apple, Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft).

CSS3 : Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.

APACHE WEB SERVER : In this project apache server is used to parse and execute PHP pages, before deploying websites on the server, the website should be tested at the developer side to get a feel of how the website will work on actual server. Therefore apache server is like a local server on the developer side, apache server should be informed about the environment on which it should work. In our project apache server is configured to work with PHP, in this way all the PHP pages are parsed and executed by the server. When apache is installed on the system, then it services is controlled by apache service monitor.
